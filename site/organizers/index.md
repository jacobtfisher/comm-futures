Planning the hackathon is a joint effort, both by the organizers and by the attendees. As all organizers contributed equally to planning the event, they are listed in randomized order. If you are interested in helping the team organize the event, please do not hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hackingcommsci@gmail.com). If you would like to propose (and lead) a breakout session to include in the hackathon, please let us know!
